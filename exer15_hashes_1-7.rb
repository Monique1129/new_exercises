# 15. Once youâ€™ve implemented the method this should print out: Hello Ada!.

# Now change your method so that instead of always using "Hello " it picks a random string from 
# the array ["Hello", "Hi", "Ohai", "ZOMG"].

# Every time you run the program it should print out either "Hello Ada!", "Hi Ada!", "Ohai Ada!", 
# or "ZOMG Ada!".

# Note: The method shuffle on arrays does, well, shuffle the array :) That means it changes the order of 
# the elements in the array in a random way.

name = "ada".capitalize

	def greet(name)

		hello = ["hello ", "hi ", "ohai ", "zomg "]

  		name.prepend (hello[2]).capitalize
  	end

	puts greet(name).concat(33)
